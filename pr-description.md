# Pull Request: Architectural Improvements

## Summary

This PR implements three major architectural improvements to enhance code quality, testability, and maintainability:

### 1. Protocol-Based Abstractions (#56)
- Introduced Python protocols for all core components (IAgent, IStep, IContext, etc.)
- Created adapter classes for smooth migration
- Added mock implementations for testing
- Enables loose coupling and better extensibility

### 2. Dependency Injection (#52)
- Implemented dependency injection for the Council class
- Created CouncilFactory and CouncilDependencies
- Removed tight coupling with concrete implementations
- Improves testability and flexibility

### 3. Council God Class Refactoring (#53)
- Extracted ErrorHandler for error strategy management
- Extracted StepOrchestrator for step execution logic
- Extracted ModeratorAssigner for debate moderation
- Council now composes these specialized components

## Changes

### New Files
- `src/konseho/protocols.py` - Protocol definitions
- `src/konseho/adapters.py` - Adapter and mock implementations
- `src/konseho/factories.py` - Dependency injection containers
- `src/konseho/core/error_handler.py` - Error handling component
- `src/konseho/core/step_orchestrator.py` - Step orchestration component
- `src/konseho/core/moderator_assigner.py` - Moderator assignment component

### Modified Files
- Updated Council class to use dependency injection and composition
- Updated all examples to use CouncilFactory
- Added comprehensive tests for new components

## Commits Included

```
69a45ca refactor(core): break up Council God Class into specialized components
dee8a40 refactor: remove legacy Council instantiation
6e23922 feat(di): implement dependency injection for Council class
1438750 feat(architecture): introduce protocol-based abstractions for core components
```

## Benefits

- **Better Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns following SOLID principles
- **Improved Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation with mocks
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations via protocols
- **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused classes are easier to understand
- **Extensibility**: New strategies and behaviors can be added without modifying existing code

## Breaking Changes

- Direct Council instantiation is no longer supported
- Must use CouncilFactory or provide CouncilDependencies
- This is intentional as the SDK is not yet in production use

## Testing

All tests pass with the new architecture. Added comprehensive test coverage for:
- Protocol compliance
- Dependency injection
- Error handling strategies
- Step orchestration
- Moderator assignment
